# Node.js Installer

This is an Electron application for installing, updating and managing versions of Node.js.

The goal is to be far more humane and user friendly than traditional methods of installation. The focus is primarily new users to Node, who are just looking for the easiest way to get started.

## To Develop

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:
